# Proposed updates to the firm’s 7‑digit industry taxonomy (aligned to 2022 NAICS)

Below are “parent” 2022 NAICS codes with recommended 7‑digit extensions and any code replacements needed from older (2017) NAICS. Where 2017 codes were retired or retitled, I’ve mapped them to the correct 2022 parent.

E. Consumer, retail, hospitality, franchising

- Replace 454110 Electronic Shopping and Mail‑Order Houses (2017). In 2022, retailers are coded by merchandise line; online vs. store is no longer the classifier. Use appropriate merchandise‑line codes for first‑party eCommerce/DTC, and use 519290 for marketplace platforms:  
  - Examples for first‑party eCommerce/DTC (pick based on primary merchandise):  
    - 458110 Clothing and Clothing Accessories Retailers (apparel)   
    - 449210 Electronics and Appliance Retailers (electronics)

  - DTC subscription/box services: code by merchandise line (e.g., 445298 All Other Specialty Food Retailers for food boxes; 456120 Cosmetics for beauty boxes) 

F. Cannabis (cross‑mapped; jurisdiction‑dependent)

- Cultivation: 111419 Other Food Crops Grown Under Cover or 111998 All Other Miscellaneous Crop Farming (indoor vs. other methods)    
- Processing/Manufacturing: 325411 Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing (extraction); food/beverage infusions use the appropriate 311/312 code (e.g., 312120 Breweries only as an example for beverages)   
- Wholesale Distribution: 424590 Other Farm Product Raw Material Merchant Wholesalers or 424990 Other Miscellaneous Nondurable Goods Merchant Wholesalers

- Ancillary Services: map to 54xxxx by activity (e.g., 541519 Other Computer Related Services; 541613 Marketing Consulting) 

G. Nonprofits and political law

- 813xxx — use specific 2022 parents and add a 7‑digit suffix for tax status:  
  - 813110 Religious Organizations (faith‑based 501(c)(3))   
  - 813211 Grantmaking Foundations (501(c)(3) private foundations)

  - 813910 Business Associations (501(c)(6) trade associations)   
  - 813940 Political Organizations (PACs/Super PACs/527s)   
  - 813990 Other Similar Organizations (catch‑all for 501(c)(3)/(c)(4) not elsewhere classified) 

H. Aerospace and defense manufacturing

- Use explicit 33641x parents in 2022:  
  - 336411 OEM/Primes (Aircraft Manufacturing)  
  - 336412 Tier‑1 (Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts)  
  - 336413 Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment  
  - 336414 Space Launch/Spacecraft (Guided Missile and Space Vehicle Manufacturing)  
  - 336415 Space Propulsion Units and Parts  
  - 336419 Other Guided Missile/Space Vehicle Parts and Auxiliary Equipment   
- MRO/Aftermarket: 488190 Other Support Activities for Air Transportation (use as services overlay; cross‑tag with 33641x where appropriate) 

Implementation notes

- Keep each 6‑digit NAICS as the “parent” and add a firm‑specific 7‑digit extension (e.g., 5231502 Prime Brokerage; 5132104 Foundation‑Model AI) for intake/CRM/experience tagging.  
- For 2017 channel‑based retail (e.g., 454110), adopt 2022 merchandise‑line parents and preserve “channel” as an internal attribute in your 7‑digit layer for BD analytics.

If you’d like, I can deliver this as a codebook (CSV/JSON): parent NAICS, 7‑digit code, definitions, typical matter types, and regulators/counterparties.
